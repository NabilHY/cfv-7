          In the difficult diagnosis scenario, option C is a better response than option D because it demonstrates empathy and validates the
          patient's feelings. When someone receives a difficult diagnosis, they are likely to experience a range of emotions, including fear,
          sadness, and anxiety. By acknowledging and empathizing with the patient's emotions, the healthcare provider can help the patient feel
          heard and supported. In contrast, option D dismisses the patient's emotions and focuses solely on the medical facts. While it is
          important for healthcare providers to provide accurate information, they also need to be mindful of the patient's emotional needs.
          Failing to address the patient's emotions can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, which can hinder their ability to cope with
